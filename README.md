## *- About*

### *What am I?*

I am a design assistant for both creatives and non-creatives that helps imagine and visualizing concepts.

### *What do I do?*

Run the code and say what you want to conceptualize, I will project the result as a hologram on the artifact. If while describing your concept you say the word "model" I will generate the hologram of a 3D model, if not, I will do it with an image that represents the concept you want.

### *How do I do it?*

The script automates the creation of a hologram from spoken words by transforming a voice description into a model or image, animating and rendering it in Blender, and then formatting video for a holographic display. The process involves speech-to-text, 3D modeling and animation, video editing, and hologram layout formatting, integrating different technologies to produce a holographic video from an initial spoken description.
